            <h2>More PopHealth Lessons learned </h2>by John Halamka
            <p>In the March HIT Standards Committee we highlighted 3 gaps in the standards needed to calculate quality metrics automatically from EHRs  1.  A longitudinal (not encounter level) patient summary format to transmit appropriate data elements from an EHR to a quality measurement entity  2.  A batch reporting format to transmit data elements for multiple patients to a quality measurement entity  3.  Although PQRI XML and QRDA have been suggested for reporting data between quality measurement entities and organizations that use this data for payment/compliance, there is not a widely adopted standard for quality reporting in production today.<a href="http://geekdoctor.blogspot.com/2012/04/more-pophealth-lessons-learned.html">Read entire article.</a></p>

            <p>While in Chicago last Thursday, I was asked how we validated our quality measures when we moved from chart abstraction to automated computation of PRQS, Meaningful Use, Pioneer ACO, and Alternative Quality Contract measures via the Massachusetts eHealth Collaborative Quality Data Center (QDC).   This is an important question because Meaningful Use Stage 2 enables easy use of modular components outside the EHR such that data can be captured in the EHR and sent to a cloud based analytics engine via standards such as CCD/C32 for content and Direct for transport.<a href="http://geekdoctor.blogspot.com/2012/03/pophealth.html">Read entire article.</a></p>
