          <h1 id="whatIshData">PQRI Quality Report XML</h1>
          The 2006 Tax Relief and Health Care Act required the establishment of a physician quality reporting system, including an incentive payment for eligible professionals (EPs) who satisfactorily report data on quality measures for covered professional services furnished to Medicare beneficiaries during the second half of 2007. CMS named this program the Physician Quality Reporting Initiative (<a href="http://www.cms.hhs.gov/pqri/" target="_external">PQRI</a>).  The PQRI was further modified as a result of the Medicare, Medicaid, and SCHIP Extension Act of 2007 and the Medicare Improvements for Patients and Providers Act of 2008

          <h1id="whatIshData">QRDA Category I</div>
          A QRDA Category I report is an individual patient-level quality report. Each report contains quality data for one or more quality measures, where the data elements in the report are defined by the particular measure(s) being reported on. A QRDA Category I report contains raw applicable patient data. When pooled and analyzed, each report contributes the quality data necessary to calculate population measure.  The current version of the CMS EHR Warehouse accepts only QRDA Category I reports.

        <div class="questionAnswer">
          <h1id="whatIshData">QRDA Category III</div>
          A QRDA Category III report is an aggregate quality report. Each report contains calculated summary data for one or more measures for a specified population of patients within a particular health system over a specific period of time.  Whereas a QRDA Category I report contain data for individual patients, a QRDA Category III report only contains calculated data (e.g., number of meeting numerator criteria, number of meeting denominator criteria) on the population.
